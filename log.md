#100 Days of Code - Log

<h2>Day 1 January 19, 2017</h2>
<b>Today's Progress:</b> 
Starting from the basics to gain coding discipline.
Worked on the HTML5/CSS section on FreeCodeCamp from the beggining, ended my session on "Link to external pages with anchor elements"

<b>Thoughts:</b>While simple, still a much needed review.

<h2>Day 3 January 21, 2017</h2>
<b>Today's Progress:</b>
Finished the html/css section on FreeCodeCamp.

<b>Thoughts:</b> Need to start getting into the routine of using a whiteboard to practice writting code, and not just copy/pasting to run through it.

<b>Today's Progress:</b>
Got half-way through the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/map-aside#nested-collapseResponsiveDesignwithBootstrap">Responsive Design with Bootstrap</a>

<b>Thoughts:</b> 
There is no formation without repetition. I'm sure I'm going to come back to these exercises once I start building some websites.

<b>Thoughts:</b> 
I'm going to adopt the phrase "Unknown Unknowns" from now on. I now that Ai exist, obviously, but I had no idea about any of it really. This world is taking me for a ride at the moment.

<h2>Day 8 January 28, 2017</h2>
<b>Today's Progress:</b>
I'm not counting yesterday because all I did was watch 2 hours of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bv_5Zv5c-Ts"> "The weird parts of Javascript" </a>.
Today, I finished the tribute project on FreeCodeCamp. 

<b>Thoughts:</b> 
This was fun. It's nice actually seeing a product than I can produce.
