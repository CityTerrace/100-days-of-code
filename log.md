#100 Days of Code - Log

<h2>Day 1 January 19, 2017</h2>
<b>Today's Progress:</b> 
Starting from the basics to gain coding discipline.
Worked on the HTML5/CSS section on FreeCodeCamp from the beggining, ended my session on "Link to external pages with anchor elements"

<b>Thoughts:</b>While simple, still a much needed review.

<h2>Day 2 January 20, 2017</h2>
<b>Today's Progress:</b>
Did a bit more of the html/css section on FreeCodeCamp.

<b>Thoughts:</b> I had forgotten how to add a button using html, wow! haha.

<h2>Day 3 January 21, 2017</h2>
<b>Today's Progress:</b>
Finished the html/css section on FreeCodeCamp.

<b>Thoughts:</b> Need to start getting into the routine of using a whiteboard to practice writting code, and not just copy/pasting to run through it.

<b>Thoughts:</b> 
I'm going to adopt the phrase "Unknown Unknowns" from now on. I now that Ai exist, obviously, but I had no idea about any of it really. This world is taking me for a ride at the moment.
